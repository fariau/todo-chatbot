[post_write_hooks]
# post_write_hooks defines scripts or Python functions that are invoked
# automatically after the completion of revision script generation.
#
# Format is a comma-separated list of hook names to run.
# Each hook is then individually configured using its own section.
# The section name is composed of the hook name, plus the "."
# character, plus the key.
#
# Each hook configuration supports the following keys:
#
# priority = the priority order of the hook. Lower numbers run first.
#   Defaults to 0.
#
# type = either "exec" or "console_scripts"
#   "exec" means the value of the hook should be a system executable,
#   which will be specified as the value of the key.
#   "console_scripts" means the value of the hook should be a
#   Python function, which will be specified as a dotted module name
#   and function name combination.
#   Console script hooks will be looked up in the "console_scripts"
#   entry point group.
#
# path = the path to the executable to invoke or the console script to run.
#   For "exec" type hooks, this is a system path. For "console_scripts"
#   type hooks, this is the dotted module name and function name.
#   Required for both exec and console_scripts type hooks.
#
# args = A space-separated list of arguments to pass to the hook.
#   Optional for both exec and console_scripts type hooks.
#
# The example below makes use of the sample "black" pre-commit hook
# distributed with Alembic in the "examples" folder.
#
# The example "black" console script hook is not installed by default;
# to enable it, install the "alembic" package with the "black" extra:
# pip install "alembic[black]"
#
# hooks = black
# black.type = console_scripts
# black.entrypoint = black
# black.options = -l 79 REVISION_SCRIPT_FILENAME
#
# The inline literal "%(rev)s" and "%(slug)s" are the revision id
# and the slug name of the revision, respectively.
#
# hooks = black
# black.type = exec
# black.path = black
# black.args = -l 79 REVISION_SCRIPT_FILENAME
